About me:
I am Abdullahi Abdurrazaq Nakore, I started my
programming journey in the year 2020 when I was 14 
years old first when my brother convinced me to 
take on the journey and I never looked back ever
since.

I started with the following languages: Scratch, C
and Python in which I learn the General concept of 
programming especially in the following domain:
1. Multi-thrade programming.
2. Game development.
3. Cryptography.
4. Data structures.
5. Data forensics.
6. Graphical user interface.
7. Software development.
8. Mobile app development.

Moreover my journey still on course to other domains
like: Artificial intelligence, Machine learning,
Web development, Blockchain programming Et cetra. And
I'm feeling like the sky is just the beginning.

The journey is very exciting however, I face some 
challenges like juggling between school and programming
activities, and I know more challenges lie ahead but I
am equal to the task Now more so than ever.

How To play:
1. Select from the modes available (single player or multiplayer).
2. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
3. You are either X or O, your friend (or the computer if the mode 
    selected is single player) is either O or X.
4. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
5. The first player to get 3 of his/her marks in a row (up, down,
    across, or diagonally) is the winner.
5. When all 9 squares are full without winning, the game is a tie.
